    quote: "Another era came to an end when Wade signed with his hometown Chicago Bulls in July 2016, after 13 seasons with the Heat. The 2016-17 campaign was a disappointing one, however, as Wade failed to garner an All-Star selection for the first time since his rookie year and the Bulls were bounced in the first round of the playoffs. A trade to Cleveland before the start of 2017-18 reunited Wade with James, but the pair were unable to rekindle the old magic, and Wade was sent back to Miami halfway through the season. No longer a starter, he still helped the Heat finish with a solid 44-38 record and earn a postseason berth.",
